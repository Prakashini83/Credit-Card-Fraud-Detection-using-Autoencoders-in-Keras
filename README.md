# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Autoencoders in Keras
# This repository uses an autoencoder to detect credit card fraud in a publically available dataset.
# Credit Card Anomaly Detection using Autoencoders is a machine learning project that involves the use of unsupervised learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal of the project is to develop an autoencoder-based model that can learn to identify anomalous patterns in credit card transactions and flag them as potentially fraudulent.
